#Order of execution
# start.sh Execution Overview

1. **File Transfer**:
   - Move the following files from `/home` to `/bak`:
     - eye.conf
     - hardinfo.bin
     - hwcfg.ini
     - ptz.cfg
     - image.ini
     - VOICE.tgz

2. **Hack File**:
   - The hack file is executed (debug_cmd.sh).
   - Start a background task with a timer (10sec) to set the timezone from config.txt.

3. **PTZ Driver Configuration**:
   - To prevent camera movement on reboot/boot:
     - Set `ptz_no_selfck=0` in `hwcfg.ini`.

4. **Timezone Setup**:
   - start.sh will try to set the time zone, it's hardcoded, to avoid this, the timed task from before is executed after, (10 sec seems to work)

6. **Start p2pcam**:
   - Start the `p2pcam` service.
